####Class Design
Extends generic behavior

####Methods overload
You can more than one version of one method
 - Same method name
 - Different number or different types or order of parameters
 - Flexible design
 - Must have the same return type
 - Must have a different number or types of parameters, or both
 
####Variable Number of Arguments
Known as varargs

 ```java
 public some(double... vargs){
    // do something
 }
 ```
 
####Constructors
Special method that initializes the object
You can reuse constructors
 - this(<other constructor parameters>);
 - a "default constructor" refers to a nullary constructor (no-args constructor) that is automatically generated by the compiler if no constructors have been defined for the class
 - It is a special method that initializes the object
 - It must be named after the class 

####Access Modifiers
 - public - Visible to any other class
 - protected - Visible to classes in the same package and subclasses
 - <default> - Only in the same package
 - private - Only in the same class
 
####Encapsulation
Hide the thins are implemented, hide the logic
 - private access modifier
 - control the access to information
 
####Define Immutability
Read-only data objects.
Good when you have multi-thread programming and concurrency.

 - Immutable are thread-safe
 - Primitive wrappers, String, LocaDate and so on.
 - Instance variables must be encapsulated with private, do not have setXXX
 - You can set variables final, but you need initialize, you can use the instance initializer
 
####Enumeration
Is a collections fixed set of instances of a particular type
 - enum keyword
 - It provides a fixed set of instances of a specific type
 - Enum values are instances of this enum type
 - Implicit public, static and final
 - Used as Variable types and switch constructs
 
####Factory Method Pattern
  ```java
public class NotificationFactory {
    public Notification createNotification(String channel)
    {
        if (channel == null || channel.isEmpty())
            return null;
        if ("SMS".equals(channel)) {
            return new SMSNotification();
        }
        else if ("EMAIL".equals(channel)) {
            return new EmailNotification();
        }
        else if ("PUSH".equals(channel)) {
            return new PushNotification();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
 ```
 
####Abstract X Interface
A class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement multiple interfaces.

See more in INHERITANCE doc.

####Member inner class associated
Instance context of the containing class

####Anonymous inner class
 - It is an implementation of an interface or extension of a class.
 - It can access outer variables, but only if they are final or effectively final.
